* Maps Hearthstone cards to vectors for easy comparison
*** Demo - https://peixian.github.io/hs2vec/
* Installation:
If you have the usual tools of the trade for ml (pandas, numpy, etc), this'll be easy. Otherwise strap in.

1. Install [[https://www.continuum.io/downloads][anaconda]] and create a new virtualenv in python3 with pandas and numpy.
3. Run the following script:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
  mkdir hearthstone_data
  cd hearthstone_data
  git clone https://github.com/peixian/Yet-Another-Hearthstone-Analyzer
  mv Yet-Another-Hearthstone-Analyzer yaha
  git clone https://github.com/peixian/hs2vec
  cd hs2vec
  mkdir test_data
#+END_SRC 
4. Install the requirements with: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC
5. Open emacs, switch to the virtualenv you just made in emacs, and you /should/ be able to run the org-babel file. Feel free to open a github issue if it doesn't work.
